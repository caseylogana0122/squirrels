    <p>Greetings from the Woods Quad!
        We are a diverse population of squirrels that work hard to keep up the spirits of the students, faculty, and staff at the University of Alabama.
        
        
        Our skills include, but are not limited to: Tree climbing, scampering, staring intently, stealing, gatherer of Russell's peanuts, balancing.
        
        Work that we pride ourselves in includes unsettled many a student, looking cute. </p>
